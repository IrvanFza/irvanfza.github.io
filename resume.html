                      </h4>
                      <p>At Ruangguru, I am responsible as Enterprise Fullstack Engineer. My main job is to help any
                        internal team, from HR to Support team.
                        We consist of small team (3-4 engineers) and don't have project manager. So we work directly with
                        the user to gather requirements, feedback and so on.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        While there are many third party applications out there, the company policy requires to manage
                        their data as independent as possible.
                        So most of internal tools like employee management, attendance application and so on are
                        self-made.
                        Sometimes, I also help the team outside Enterprise team when my work load is not too much. I learn
                        Go language and the implementation of microservice architecture there.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        When worked at SweetEscape, the workflow that I used to have was like cooking the food without the
                        need of finding ingredients.
                        But it's different here. It's like I am back to basic. From gathering requirements, analyzing and
                        designing the system, adding project estimation until testing and deploying it to live.
                        I'm glad that I can learn a lot of new things. From project management, handling user request and
                        working on more than one application in almost the same time.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Overall, I really love the working culture here. Everyone is very open about their knowledge.
                        We do tech sharing and PDC quite often. We also have the best infra and productivity team here.
                        Because one of engineer DNA here is everyone is responsible with their own product from end to
                        end, from development to deployment.
                        They provide us the best devops tools, so we can easily deploy, scale and debug our application.

                      </h4>
                      <p>This was my first experience job on tech startup. I was experiencing on what I so-called,
                        work-cultural shock. The way of work and the work environment was really different to companies I
                        work before. I talked about the flexibility on how you dress, work hour and WFH culture.</p>
                      <p>The software development cycle was not so different, obviously. The company I work before also
                        implement scrum that used here. The only different was, here I only responsible on a single
                        product/application, the development cycle was well-organized and all new request/requirements
                        gathering was done by project managers.</p>
                      <p>It was really challenging here. I had zero experience on Ruby (with Ruby on Rails) and ReactJS
                        before. So for almost the first 3 weeks, I had nothing to do except to learn them first.</p>
                      <p>We also implement a very strict software testing (TDD and BDD) and code review. For every
                        bugfixes or new feature, it is a must to pass every test and already reviewed by other developers.
                        Since we use monolithic architecture, even small changes can be very impactful.</p>

                      <p>
                        Nufaza is an IT consulting company. It received pretty much request of new applications/projects.
                        Most of them are web-based. So my goal of receiving hands-on experience could be achieved
                        here.</p>
                      <p>
                        I started by creating HTML template for the backend teams. Then gradually join the project from
                        end to end.
                        I was included in meeting with client to gather requirement, analyze and design it, and start the
                        development phase until delivery to client.
                        I learned the very basic of software development cycle (using scrum) here.

                        Most of Nufaza's clients are from Minister of Education departments.
                        So after finishing the required application, I and the team were responsible to socialize on how
                        to use the application to the related user.
                        Whether it's the teachers, students or even to the local public education officers.
                        Here, I also got experience on public speaking to quite large audience (200-300 participants), and
                        a chance to visit to many cities in Indonesia.</p>

                      <p>I can say this was actually my first job that require some of my programming knowledge. But I
                        could only last a year because I need a hand on experience on how to build application. You can
                        find my articles under <a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/author/irfan_fauzii/"

                        enthusiast job (programmer). Mostly I wrote about jQuery plugins that still popular back there
